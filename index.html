        <p class="about-1">Lookables is a collection of 3333 emotional collectibles living on the Solana Blockchain.
            <br> We aim to bring people together through the power of shared tales, desires, memes,
            <br> and personal stories through a social hub where everyone can build meaningful
            <br> connections, relate with one another and share their experiences with sense of awareness.

        <h1 class="looki">LOOKIFESTO</h1>
        <p class="lookif">In a technologically complex space consisting of people all over the world, we can all agree that we all
            <br> have emotions. Sometimes, we're over-excited over a successful NFT flip or achieving a personal goal outside of NFTs.
            <br> Other times we feel down over an argument we had with someone close to us, or perhaps we're burned in an NFT scam.
            <br> In and out of the NFT space, we have experiences that ignite emotions within us.
            <br> It isn't possible to find someone to express our wins, hopes, joys, and losses with.
            <br> Besides, many people who don't trade NFTs cannot relate to the challenges we face.
            <br>Our project hopes to change that by offering what some of us may not be experiencing in our daily lives.
            <br>A safe space
            <br> An open ear
            <br>A judgment-free zone
            <br>A fun place to vibe out with like-minded people.

                <h3>What are NFTs?</h3>
                <p>NFT stands for “Non-Fungible Token” which are unique digital items that are stored
                    <br> and encrypted on the blockchain that people can buy, own, and trade.
                    <br> NFTs can simply be digital art but can have various benefits.
                    <br> They can be treated like membership cards where holders get exclusive access
                    <br> to things like websites, events, merchandise, and more.</p>
